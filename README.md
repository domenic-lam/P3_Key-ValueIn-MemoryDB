# P3_Key-ValueIn-MemoryDB
 In this practicum you will modify the database you built for previous projects to adjust them to a key-value in-memory database (Redis). You can reuse the project description, selecting one data structure that makes sense to be implemented as an in-memory store. Finally you will modify your existing codebase to make it work with Node and Redis.
